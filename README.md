# Diabetes Prediction Shiny Application
This repository contains all the needed files for the Shiny application assignment. For the assignment, a small diabetes prediction application was written using the PimaIndiansDiabetes dataset available in R. The files are:

- The global.R, ui.R and server.R containing the R code files needed to run the application.
- PresentationApp.Rmd, which is the Rmarkdown file containing the code for the presentation slides.
- PresentationApp.html, or index.html, which is the html output of the Rmarkdown file.

The application itself can be found on the following link, hosted by the shinyapps.io servers :

The presentation slides for the application can be found on the following link :
